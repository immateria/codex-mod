# Android Build Success

## Binary Built Successfully

The `code` CLI binary has been successfully compiled for Android aarch64 (ARM64).

### Binary Location
```
code-rs/target/aarch64-linux-android/debug/code
```

### Binary Specifications
- **Architecture**: ARM aarch64 (64-bit)
- **Platform**: Linux (Android)
- **Format**: ELF 64-bit LSB PIE executable
- **Linker**: /system/bin/linker64 (Android dynamic linker)
- **Size**: ~848MB (debug build with symbols)

### How It Was Built

1. **OpenSSL for Android**: Built from source using OpenSSL 1.1.1w with the Android NDK aarch64 clang compiler
   - Location: `/tmp/openssl-android-aarch64`
   - Includes: libssl.a, libcrypto.a, and shared libraries

2. **Android NDK**: Used aarch64-linux-android24-clang as the cross-compiler
   - Linker: `aarch64-linux-android24-clang`
   - Archiver: `llvm-ar` from NDK
   - API Level: 24 (Android 7.0+)

3. **Patches Applied**: All 8 Android-specific patches integrated
   - TUI reqwest configuration for Android
   - Login server with termux-open-url support
   - Shell detection via $SHELL environment variable
   - Disabled sandbox (Termux limitation)
   - Build profile optimizations
   - Clipboard feature conditionally disabled

### Ready for Deployment

The binary is now ready to be transferred to your Android device running Termux:

```bash
# Copy binary to device
adb push code-rs/target/aarch64-linux-android/debug/code /path/on/device/code

# Make executable
adb shell chmod +x /path/on/device/code

# Test it
adb shell /path/on/device/code --version
```

### Known Limitations

- **Clipboard disabled**: The arboard crate doesn't support Android, so clipboard functionality is disabled
- **Debug build**: This is an unoptimized debug build with debug symbols (~848MB). A release build would be much smaller (~50-100MB)
- **Sandbox disabled**: Termux doesn't support the OS-level sandboxing, so that feature is disabled

### Next Steps

1. Transfer the binary to your Android device via ADB
2. Test basic functionality: `code --version`
3. Test with actual input/files
4. Optionally build a release version for smaller size: `cargo build --bin code --target aarch64-linux-android --release`

### Environment Variables for Rebuilding

If you need to rebuild, set these environment variables:

```bash
export OPENSSL_DIR="/tmp/openssl-android-aarch64"
export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT="/opt/homebrew/share/android-ndk"
export TOOLCHAIN_PATH="$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64"
export CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER="$TOOLCHAIN_PATH/bin/aarch64-linux-android24-clang"
export CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_AR="$TOOLCHAIN_PATH/bin/llvm-ar"

# Then build
cd code-rs
cargo build --bin code --target aarch64-linux-android
```
